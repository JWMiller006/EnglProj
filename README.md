# English Project
## About
This is a project done for my enlgish class during my senior year. The code is downloadable from the bin folder (bin/x64/Release)

## Usage
### Dependencies
* .NET Framework 4.8
* .NET Core 6.0
* JIT Compiler Support

### Opening File
The file that constitutes the final project is the EnglProj.exe, though there is another console based tool in the ModelHandler folder 
#### ModelHandler
This tool is soemthing that the program uses to anylize the sentiment of the text. It could use a little more training (it is around 64% accurate with the text given so far) with some other text other than 200 reviews. 
Example usage:
```
./EnglishProject.exe run "{text that you want to anylize}"
```
